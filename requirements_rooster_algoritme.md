i want to make a python script that does the following:

first, it should make a list of tasks. those are the following:
badkamer A
badkamer B
fusie
huisboodschappen
aanrecht
WC A
WC B
keukenvloer
kookpitten
vuile was
gangen
papier en glas
ovens & balkon

then, there are two lists of people:

gang A: Maria, Tim, Samuel, Jojanne, Indrah, Julian, Linde

gang B: Joost, Emma, Steven, Knut, Milan, Pepijn, Tessa, Jolieke

These people should then be allocated to a task. The first time this can be random, but after that, they should be rotated on a fair basis, so every person does every task the same amount of times. after 15 weeks everyone should have done each task once, and we can start over.

as you can see, some tasks are marked with A or B at the end. These tasks can only be done by people that belong to the corresponding gang. 

there are also fewer tasks than there are people. this means that every week, 3 people are free. this too, should be done as fairly as possible.
